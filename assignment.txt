1.How does AI differ from traditional programming?
   
  In traditional programming a human developer provides the rules and the data to the computer to get answer.
  In AI the human provides the data and the answer to the computer and the computer generates the rules.
  Traditional programming tells computers what to do.
  AI teaches computers how to figure it out.

2.What are some real-world applications of AI? 
   
   Voice assistants (Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant)
   Face and object recognition
   Personalized learning: Adapts lessons to each student’s pace and style.
   Self-driving and driver-assist systems: Lane keeping, adaptive cruise control, automatic braking.
   Virtual health assistants

3.Explain the difference between Narrow AI, General AI and Super AI.
 
  Narrow AI : Narrow AI is a branch of artificial intelligence that is specialized in performing a 
  single task or a limited set of tasks with high efficiency and accuracy. This is also known as 
  Weak AI, refers to artificial intelligence systems that are designed and trained to perform one 
  specific task or a limited range of tasks extremely well. These systems are “narrow” because 
  their intelligence is confined to a particular area, they cannot perform tasks outside the field they 
  were built for.  
   
  General AI : General AI, also known as Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), is a form of 
  artificial intelligence that can perform any intellectual task just like a human. Unlike Narrow AI, 
  which is restricted to specific functions such as speech recognition or facial detection, General 
  AI aims to replicate human-like reasoning, problem-solving, learning, creativity, and 
  adaptability. It can transfer knowledge from one domain to another, similar to how humans apply 
  skills learned in one area to different situations. However, AGI is still theoretical and has not yet 
  been achieved. Developing it would require major breakthroughs in neuroscience, cognitive 
  science, and machine learning. In essence, General AI represents the ultimate goal of creating 
  machines with human-level intelligence and flexibility across all domains
   
  Super AI : Super Artificial Intelligence (Super AI) is a hypothetical stage of AI development 
  where machines surpass human intelligence in every possible way. Unlike Narrow AI, which is 
  task-specific, and General AI, which matches human-level intelligence, Super AI would 
  outperform humans in reasoning, creativity, decision-making, emotional understanding, and 
  social interactions. It would have the ability to learn autonomously, understand complex 
  concepts, and apply knowledge across any domain—science, medicine, or art—without human 
  input. Super AI may even develop self-awareness, emotions, and independent goals. Although it 
  does not exist yet, its potential could revolutionize the world by solving major global challenges 
  and creating unimaginable technologies. However, it also raises serious ethical and safety 
  concerns regarding control, regulation, and alignment with human values.

4.Explain how Super AI could potentially surpass human intelligence. 

  Humans: neurons fire ~200 times per second
  Computers: billions–trillions of operations per second
  Store and recall all human knowledge
  
5.What ethical concerns are associated with Super AI? 
 
  DATA privacy 
  
6.What is Reactive Machine AI? Give examples. 

  Reactive Machine AI is the most basic type of artificial intelligence. It does not have memory, 
  cannot learn from past experiences, and only reacts to the current situation based on
  predefined rules or patterns.
  
7.Explain the concept of Theory of Mind AI.

  Theory of Mind AI refers to a hypothetical or emerging class of AI systems designed to understand and model the mental states of others—such as beliefs, 
  intentions, emotions, and desires—and use that understanding to guide their interactions.

8.How does Limited Memory AI differ from Reactive AI? 
  
  Reactive AI: Responds only to current input and has no memory or learning.
  Limited Memory AI: Uses past data or experiences to make better decisions.

9.How does Machine Learning relate to Artificial Intelligence? 

  Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that enables machines to learn from data and improve their performance 
  without being explicitly programmed.

10.Give examples of Machine Learning applications in daily life.

   Voice assistants understand and respond to spoken commands.
   Smartphones use face recognition to unlock devices.
   Netflix and YouTube recommend content you may like.
   Social media shows posts based on your interests.

11.What is the difference between training and testing data?

   Training data is used to teach the model.
   Testing data is used to check how well the model works on new, unseen data.

12.Which learning method is best suited for labeled data? 

   Supervised learning is best suited for labeled data.

13.Compare Supervised and Unsupervised Learning.

   Supervised Learning

 Uses labeled data
 Learns from input–output pairs
 Used for prediction and classification

  Unsupervised Learning

 Uses unlabeled data
 Finds hidden patterns or groups
 Used for clustering and data exploration

14.Explain the difference between classification and regression. 

    Classification
  Predicts categories or class
  
    Regression
Predicts numerical values

15.What is overfitting in supervised learning? 
 
  Overfitting is when a model learns the training data too well, including noise, and performs poorly on new data.

16.How does unsupervised learning differ from supervised learning?

  Supervised learning:
  Uses labeled data to learn input → output relationships 

  Unsupervised learning:
  Uses unlabeled data to find patterns or structure 

17.What is dimensionality reduction? 

   Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of features in a dataset while keeping the most important information.

18.How does reinforcement learning differ from supervised learning?

   Reinforcement learning:
   An agent learns by interacting with an environment and getting rewards or penalties.

   Supervised learning:
   Learns from labeled data with correct answers provided.

19. Explain the concept of “reward” in RL

   In reinforcement learning, a reward is a numerical feedback signal that tells the agent how good or bad an action was,
   guiding it to learn better behavior  over time.

20.What are some challenges in unsupervised learning? 

   Some challenges in unsupervised learning include lack of labels, difficulty evaluating results, choosing the right number of patterns or clusters,
   and   interpreting discovered structures.
